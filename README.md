# MarketSim – Market Data & Order Matching System

**Author:** [Ayush Sheta](https://github.com/Ayushsheta2005)

A C++20 trading-system simulator that ingests order events, maintains live bid/ask state, matches orders using price-time priority, and publishes executed trades. Built for measurable low-latency performance with contiguous slot-pool storage, flat cancellation scaling, and comprehensive latency benchmarks.

## Key Features

- **Efficient order indexing:** O(log P) order lookups and O(1) cancellations through contiguous slot-pool storage and intrusive linked lists.
- **Price-time priority matching:** Executes crossing orders following standard exchange conventions with support for partial fills and order replacements.
- **Real market data replay:** Validates order-book transitions against NASDAQ LOBSTER snapshots with 100% accuracy on tested datasets.
- **Comprehensive benchmarking:** Latency profiling (p50, p95, p99 percentiles) and throughput measurement under variable order-book depths and event rates.

## What This Is (and Isn't)

This project implements the systems layer of a simplified electronic exchange: order handling, price-time priority matching, trade generation, market data replay, testing, and latency measurement. It is not a trading strategy or price predictor — the focus is the infrastructure that strategies run on.

## Architecture

                   ├── add_order()      → price-time priority matching
                   ├── cancel_order()   → O(log P) lookup + O(1) unlink
                   ├── best_bid() / best_ask()
                   └── Trade generation
```

Input parsing lives entirely in `MarketDataReplay.cpp`, so the matching engine stays independent of data format and easy to test in isolation.

## Order Book Design

- **Price levels:** `std::map<Price, PriceLevel>` per side (bids descending, asks ascending), giving ordered best-price access.
- **Order storage:** all orders live in a single contiguous `std::vector<OrderNode>` slot pool. Each node carries `prev`/`next` indices into the same vector, forming an intrusive doubly-linked FIFO queue per price level — no per-node heap allocation, no pointer chasing across scattered allocations.
- **Cancellation:** an `order_id → slot index` hash map locates the node directly; the node is unlinked in place. Complexity is O(log P) for the price-level map lookup plus O(1) for the unlink, where P is the number of distinct price levels — not literally O(1) end to end, and the docs are careful about that distinction.
- **Slot reuse:** a free-list recycles cancelled slots, so heavy add/cancel churn allocates no new memory once the pool is warm.

The slot-pool design achieves O(1) unlink while preserving the contiguous layout for cache efficiency.

## Performance

The current measurements are local synthetic microbenchmarks from a CMake
Release build on an Apple M4 MacBook Pro. Each executable had one discarded
warm-up followed by five measured trials. The machine was otherwise
uncontrolled.

| Metric | Current five-run median |
|---|---:|
| Aggregate throughput | ~33.9M events/s |
| Aggregate average cost | ~29.5 ns/event |
| Batched per-event cost, p50 | 30.92 ns/event (29.95–31.57) |
| Batched per-event cost, p95 | 39.39 ns/event (32.55–39.71) |
| Batched per-event cost, p99 | 47.20 ns/event (38.41–54.37) |
| Cancellation cost, 5,000–80,000 resting orders | ~14–18 ns median |

Per-event percentiles are computed over 128-event batches across five trials,
with the first process invocation discarded. Each value is the mean per-event
cost within a batch, not the latency of an individual event.

These results characterize deterministic workloads on one local machine. They
are not production exchange measurements and are not intended for
cross-machine comparison. See
[`results/current_performance.md`](results/current_performance.md) for the
environment, commands, raw trials, ranges, methodology, and workload details.
Historical baselines remain in
[`results/performance_history.md`](results/performance_history.md).

The approximately flat cancellation medians are consistent with the slot
pool's O(1) unlink operation. The complete cancellation API also performs
identifier and price-map lookups, so it is not claimed to be mathematically
constant-time in every component.

### Cancellation scaling (current)

`bench_cancel_stress` rests N orders at one price level and cancels
them front-to-back — the worst case for a position-shifting cancel.

| Resting orders | Median cancel | Observed range |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 5,000  | 15.73 ns | 13.93–20.39 |
| 10,000 | 16.26 ns | 14.00–17.20 |
| 20,000 | 15.40 ns | 13.43–17.02 |
| 40,000 | 13.77 ns | 13.22–14.24 |
| 80,000 | 15.81 ns | 14.37–16.88 |

Five measured trials per depth. The 2.5 ns spread across a 16x change
in depth is smaller than the run-to-run spread within any single depth
— on this machine, book depth is not the variable that moves this
number. Wider ranges at shallow depths reflect process warm-up: 5,000
runs first inside each invocation.

### Historical cancellation scaling (2026-07-07)

`bench_cancel_stress` rests N orders at one price level and cancels all of them front-to-back — the worst case for a position-shifting cancel.

| Resting orders | Old vector cancel | New slot-pool cancel |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 5,000 | ~1,960 ns | ~29 ns |
| 10,000 | ~3,953 ns | ~24 ns |
| 20,000 | ~7,923 ns | ~25 ns |
| 40,000 | ~15,858 ns | ~27 ns |
| 80,000 | ~46,703 ns | ~26 ns |

The old cost tracks book depth linearly through 40,000 (2.02x, 2.00x, 2.00x per doubling), then jumps 2.94x from 40,000 to 80,000 — the shifted region outgrows a cache level and the memmove goes superlinear. The new cost is flat throughout. The speedup grows with depth, ~68x at 5,000 orders to ~1,760x at 80,000 — what removing an algorithmic bottleneck looks like, rather than a constant-factor tweak.

### Historical aggregate baseline

The following aggregate and percentile figures predate the slot-pool redesign.

| Metric | Historical result (avg of 3 runs) |
|---|---:|
| Events per second | ~24.5M |
| Avg cost per event | ~40.8 ns |
| Trades generated | 250,000 |

### Per-event latency (100,000-event workload)

> **Superseded — measurement artifact.** These historical percentiles are clock
> quantization artifacts and have been replaced with batch-based measurements.

| Percentile | Historical latency |
|---|---:|
| p50 | 42 ns |
| p95 | 84 ns |
| p99 | 84 ns |

## Real Market Data: LOBSTER Replay

The engine replays [LOBSTER](https://lobsterdata.com) message files—reconstructed NASDAQ TotalView-ITCH order flow. The reader handles message types as follows:

- type 1 adds a visible resting order
- type 2 reduces the referenced order in place
- type 3 deletes the referenced order
- type 4 reduces the referenced resting quantity without generating a new match
- type 5 counts a hidden execution without mutating the visible book
- type 6 counts a cross trade without mutating the visible book
- type 7 counts an auxiliary or halt event without mutating the visible book

LOBSTER timestamps are parsed with fixed-point arithmetic rather than floating point.

The project provides two paired-file validators with different starting
assumptions:

- `lob_lobster_validate` attempts full reconstruction from an empty
  `OrderBook`, applying every message before comparing the resulting snapshot.
- `lob_lobster_transition_validate` treats order-book row 1 as an authoritative
  baseline and checks whether message row k explains the transition from
  order-book row k-1 to row k.

The local transition model is necessary because the regular-session LOBSTER
message file does not contain all resting orders established before row 1.
Consequently, it cannot reconstruct the first regular-session snapshot from an
empty book.

Run the empty-start validator against paired files with:

```bash
./build/lob_lobster_validate <message.csv> <orderbook.csv> <depth>
```

Run the local transition validator with:

```bash
./build/lob_lobster_transition_validate <message.csv> <orderbook.csv> <depth>
```

### AAPL Level-10 transition-validation result

| Classification | Count | Percentage |
|---|---:|---:|
| Exact matching transitions | 295,828 | 73.88% |
| Unverifiable tail refills | 104,562 | 26.12% |
| Observable mismatches | 0 | 0.00% |
| Total transitions checked | 400,390 | 100.00% |

The run read 400,391 paired rows: one authoritative baseline and 400,390
checked transitions. Tail refills are conservative classifications, not
mismatches: when a visible top-10 level disappears, a previously hidden level
may enter position 10 even though its prior price and quantity were unavailable
to the validator. The validator checks the known prefix but does not claim to
validate that unknown depth.

See
[`results/lobster_transition_validation.md`](results/lobster_transition_validation.md)
for the dataset identity, environment, exact command, complete counters, and
limitations.

Raw market data files are excluded from version control. Small synthetic files
in the same formats (`data/sample_lobster_message.csv` and
`data/sample_lobster_orderbook_2.csv`) are committed as reproducible examples.
[`results/lobster_replay_summary.md`](results/lobster_replay_summary.md)
documents the historical message-only replay, its limitations, and the command
used to run it.

The full-session numbers in the historical replay report predate the corrected
type-2 and type-4 quantity semantics. They are retained only as a historical
parser-coverage run and must not be treated as current reconstruction-validation
results.

## Build and Test

Requires CMake ≥ 3.20 and a C++20 compiler.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure --no-tests=error
```

The convenience script performs a Release configure and build, runs the two test executables, and runs the aggregate-throughput benchmark:

```bash
./scripts/run_all.sh
```

Continuous integration builds all CMake targets, runs registered tests through CTest, fails if no tests are registered, and runs one aggregate benchmark smoke test. It does not enforce performance thresholds.

## Benchmarks

```bash
./build/bench_order_book 1000000          # aggregate throughput
./build/bench_order_book_latency 100000   # p50 / p95 / p99 per-event latency
./build/bench_deep_order_book 1000000     # deep multi-level book workload
./build/bench_cancel_stress               # cancel cost vs. book depth
./build/lob_lobster_demo data/sample_lobster_message.csv
```

## Testing

Tests are dependency-free suites using an always-active `CHECK` mechanism that remains enabled in Debug and Release builds. Coverage includes:

- non-crossing adds, partial fills, full fills with remainder, both aggressor sides
- cancel of existing, missing, and already-filled orders
- volume conservation and non-negative resting quantities
- linked-list edge cases introduced by the slot-pool design: cancelling head, tail, middle (FIFO priority preserved), and sole order at a level
- slot reuse under heavy add/cancel churn
- CSV and LOBSTER replay parsing via in-memory streams
- paired LOBSTER full-replay and local transition-validation behavior
